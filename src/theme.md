## Theme Management Documentation

üé® This code snippet provides a module for managing color themes and theme settings in a React application using Material-UI (MUI).

### 1. Color Design Tokens

The `tokens(mode)` function defines a set of color design tokens based on the provided mode (either "dark" or "light"). These tokens represent different colors used throughout the theme.

### 2. Theme Settings Generation

The `themeSettings(mode)` function generates the MUI theme settings based on the provided mode. It utilizes the color design tokens obtained from `tokens(mode)` to configure the palette, typography, and other theme-related properties.

- The `palette` object defines the color palette for the theme, including the primary, secondary, and neutral colors. The actual colors used are determined based on the mode.
- The `typography` object specifies the typography settings for various elements, such as the font family and font sizes.

### 3. Color Mode Context

The `ColorModeContext` is a React context created using `createContext()`. It provides a `toggleColorMode` function that allows switching between the light and dark color modes.

### 4. Custom Hook: `useMode()`

The `useMode()` hook combines the theme and color mode management functionality. It returns the current theme and color mode as an array.

- The hook uses the `useState` hook to manage the mode state, initialized with a default value of "light".
- The `colorMode` object is created using the `useMemo` hook, which memoizes the `toggleColorMode` function. This function updates the mode state, toggling between "light" and "dark" modes.
- The `theme` object is also memoized using the `useMemo` hook, which generates the MUI theme based on the current mode using the `themeSettings(mode)` function.

### Example Usage

To utilize this theme management module in a React application, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary functions and objects from the module.
2. Call the `useMode()` hook in a component to get the current theme and color mode.
3. Apply the theme to the relevant components using MUI's `ThemeProvider`.
4. Use the `ColorModeContext` to provide the color mode context to the component tree.
5. Utilize the `toggleColorMode` function from the context to toggle between light and dark modes.

üìù This documentation provides an overview of the functionality and usage of the theme management module. It allows new developers to understand how to integrate and utilize the module in their React applications.
